- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TyPhipps
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Azure and Cloud Computing. Currently work in a support role but looking to transition into an Azure Cloud Admin role(hopefully soon)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and how to navigate within the Azure portal. Looking to make the two working together
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: you can email me at tyler.phipps.1999@gmail.com for any feedback or any tips on this. Even though I'm 22, I never got into programming before. 
Hopefully I will now and can stick with it!
